/**
    Your function takes two arguments:

    current father's age (years)
    current age of his son (years)
    Ð¡alculate how many years ago the father was 
    twice as old as his son (or in how many years 
    he will be twice as old). The answer is always 
    greater or equal to 0, no matter if it was in 
    the past or it is in the future.
